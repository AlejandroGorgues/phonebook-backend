# phonebook-backend
This repository contains the code to run the full phonebook web application related to the phonebook project developed on the [fullstackopen](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) free course of the Helsinki University.

More specifically, with the dist folder generated from the frontend and copied to this root folder, it can be deployed only one time.

The functionality of the backend behaves the same as the ones declared in the frontend repository.

## Extra
* For testing purposes, this repository has been deployed on the free tier of the Render service.
* The link to the frontend repository is [here](https://github.com/AlejandroGorgues/phonebook-frontend).
